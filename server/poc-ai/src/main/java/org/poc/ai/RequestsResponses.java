Specifically, attempt to interpret any conditional statements which look like 'IF' followed by some condition. Group your explanations by individual paragraphs, sections, and variables.

If the vendor is the main vendor, it sets certain variables and then calls the [GET-TASI-2918] paragraph to retrieve data for that vendor. If the vendor is a vendor of TASI-2918, it sets a flag in [COPRI-IND-CHRYSLER].",
            "Following that, the code further assigns values to various fields based on conditions regarding the type of vendor. If the field [PRICE-INPUT] is true, it sets the [COPRI-SOURCE-IND] to 'M'. If a certain condition is met in the variable [VIDET-IND-ORGPRICE], it sets the [COPRI-SOURCE-IND] to different values.",
